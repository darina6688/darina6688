### Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

<!--

I'm Darina, from Moscow.  
I love working with data, processing and analyzing it to identify patterns and trends, searching for the most important metrics, and also visualizing them and presenting the results of my work.  
I'd like to expand my knowledge of Python and SQL, using these skills in data analysis and solving different global and interesting problems.  
Now I am currently studing on Karpov.courses for Â«Data AnalystÂ».  

In this profile I post my projects, that I solved during my studies and also my future pet-projects.  

I believe that being an analyst helps people to make better decisions and improve their lives. Data analyst is a profession that requires a lot of effort and knowledge, but it also brings great satisfaction and joy in achieving results.  
In my free time I broaden my horizons by reading books, studying English and German, and of course, the best activity for me is travelling.
