I'd like to expand my knowledge of Python and SQL, using these skills in data analysis and solving different global and interesting problems.  
Now I am currently studing on Karpov.courses for Â«Data AnalystÂ».

I believe that being an analyst helps people to make better decisions and improve their lives. Data analyst is a profession that requires a lot of effort and knowledge, but it also brings great satisfaction and joy in achieving results.  
In my free time I broaden my horizons by reading books, studying English and German, and of course, the best activity for me is travelling.
